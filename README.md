# comparision Of Classifier On Reviews
#### NLP

[data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddharthshah3030/comparisionOfClassifiers_NLP/master/dataset.tsv)
program to compare various classifiers on datasets based on

  - accuracy
  - precision
  - F1Score



You can also:
  - add more classifiers
  - use custom datasets



as of now it is not well structured and organised
### Classifiers 
some of the best and common classifiers are used 

* #### Knaive bayes
* #### Random forest
* #### stochastic gradient descent
* #### Decision tree 
* #### KNN
* #### SVM

And of course feel free to add more 

### Installation

```sh
$ python main.py
```
you're set to compare them on other datasets as well

### Results 

result is based on given dataset
all values are in percentage 

| Classifier| Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1Score |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| KNN | 61 | 46 | 67 | 55 |
| DecisionTree | 67 | 60 | 71 | 65 |
| NaiveBayes | 73 | 88 | 68 | 77 |
| SGD | 75 | 73 | 77 | 75 |
| SVM | 72 | 68 | 75 | 71 |
| RandomForest | 63 | 41 | 76 | 54 |
### Todos

 - add more classifiers
 - organise whole project
 - update results from other datasets also
